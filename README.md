# B Nomic History

For a bit, I played in a Nomic. B Nomic to be specific. It was quite
fun.

The game is now defunct but the message archives are still online:

* [spoon-business](http://lists.ellipsis.cx/archives/spoon-business)
* [spoon-discuss](http://lists.ellipsis.cx/archives/spoon-discuss)

The wiki that contained the rules and game state is no longer around. 
I did manage to find a snapshot from here:

* http://agora-notary.wikidot.com/deleted:b-nomic

I have no clue when it was from, but it is a ruleset I remember. I've copied 
those rules, reformatted them, and placed them in this repository.

I yell CREAMPUFF!
