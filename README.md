# B Nomic History

For a bit I played in a Nomic. B Nomic to be specific. It was quite
fun.

The game is now defunct but the message archives are still online:

* [spoon-business](http://lists.ellipsis.cx/archives/spoon-business)
* [spoon-discuss](http://lists.ellipsis.cx/archives/spoon-discuss)

The wiki that contained the rules and game state is no longer around. 
I did manage to find a snapshot from here:

* http://agora-notary.wikidot.com/deleted:b-nomic

I have no clue when it was from, but it is a ruleset I remember. I've copied 
those rules, reformatted them, and placed them in this repository.

* [Ruleset of B Nomic from some undetermined time](RULES.md)

I have now searched on the Internet Archive and have found more. 

## Rules

* [July 19, 2007](rules/rules.2007-07-19.md)
* [September 6, 2017](rules/rules.2007-09.06.md)

Rules have been reformatted, by hand, into Markdown by hand. Errors in the 
translation are likely.
